products.</p><p>A few years ago I stumbled on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAR-1Z9nAAo">this video from Maker’s Muse</a>.<br>They were testing out a 3D printable headset called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://headamame.com/">head(amame)</a>.<br>I thought that was really interesting, but that my 3D printing skills were not good enough to finish such a project.</p><p>That changed recently.<br>With the release of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.printables.com/model/534566-headamame-v21-3d-printable-hi-fi-headphones">head(amame) v2.1</a> I thought it was the time to try this out.</p><p>Also…</p><blockquote><p>I needed a new headset</p></blockquote><p>The options were:</p><ol><li>I could have ordered a fully assembled version.</li><li>I could have ordered a kit, printed some parts myself, and assembled it.</li></ol><p>So I <strong>obviously</strong> went with option (3), i.e. order my own components, modify the design to align it with my requirements and components, learn how to use PETG and TPU, 3D print it in PETG and TPU, solder a bunch of stuff, assembled it, and…<br><strong>hope that I didn’t make some rookie mistake.</strong></p><h2 id="Changes-to-the-design"><a href="#Changes-to-the-design" class="headerlink" title="Changes to the design"></a>Changes to the design</h2><h3 id="3-5mm-jack"><a href="#3-5mm-jack" class="headerlink" title="3.5mm jack"></a>3.5mm jack</h3><p>While I think that the original design with the 2 Mini-XLRs is really cool, especially to audio experts, it is a bit excessive for me.<br><strong>I just wanted a good old 3.5mm jack.</strong></p><p>And here comes the community.<br>An <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.printables.com/model/555791-headamame-35mm-jack-adapter">adapter</a> from the Mini-XLR socket to a relatively standard 3.5mm jack is already available out there.</p><h3 id="A-single-stereo-cable"><a href="#A-single-stereo-cable" class="headerlink" title="A single stereo cable"></a>A single stereo cable</h3><p>While I think that audio experts will really don’t like this…<br><strong>I just wanted a single cable.</strong></p><p>So…<br>a few changes to the design later…<br>Here is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.printables.com/model/1442981-headamame-cones-for-a-top-side-to-side-wire">my modified version</a> which adds 2 additional ports on the top for a 3.5mm jack which will connect the 2 sides.</p><p>A bit of clever, maybe not, wiring, i.e. having the right channel being routed through the left ear, and the “but you will end up having different wire lengths to the 2 sides” comment is covered.</p><p>With a bit of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.printables.com/model/235168-headamame-extras">“extra”</a> help from the community and even the problem of fixing the cable in place is solved.</p><h3 id="105mm-cushions"><a href="#105mm-cushions" class="headerlink" title="105mm cushions"></a>105mm cushions</h3><p>While I really like the design of the standard kit, I really wanted to be able to find replacement cushions.</p><p>So…</p><p>Here is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.printables.com/model/1442968-105mm-earpad-mounts-for-headamame">my modified version</a> which allows to use 105mm cushions.</p><h3 id="3D-print-as-much-as-possible"><a href="#3D-print-as-much-as-possible" class="headerlink" title="3D print as much as possible"></a>3D print as much as possible</h3><p>While I could have still bought some of the original components, I really wanted to try to print as much as possible.</p><p>Here comes the community help again.<br>Here is a replacement <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6156368">Rubber Bumper</a> and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
