Maintaining both <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Italian</strong> is time consuming and the majority of the feedback I got was related to English content.</p><p>The interesting old posts have already been ported and new ones will come soon.</p><p>My intention is to start releasing at least a new blog post every week.</p><blockquote><p>Let’s see if I can do it.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="sign"><p>Carlo Bernashina<br><i><small>2019-07-14</small></i></p></blockquote></div><footer><a rel="license,noopener" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://licensebuttons.net/l/by/4.0/88x31.png"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license,noopener" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.<br><br><a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></footer><script>!function(){if(localStorage){var e=document.querySelector(".theme-switcher > input");if(e){switch(localStorage.getItem("theme")){case"dark-theme":e.checked=!0;break;case"light-theme":default:e.checked=!1}e.addEventListener("change",(function(){localStorage.setItem("theme",e.checked?"dark-theme":"light-theme"),reloadTheme()}))}}}()</script></body></html>
