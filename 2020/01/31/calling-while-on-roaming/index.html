There are many network providers in the world; each one has a different <strong>mobile network</strong>.</p><p>The home of your network provider is called your “<strong>home network</strong>“. Any other network you connect to is called a “<strong>visitor network</strong>“. When you are on a Visitor Network you are <strong>roaming</strong>.</p><p>While roaming your normal tariffs do not apply and, depending on the laws (e.g. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_roaming_regulations">EU Roaming Regulations</a>) and contracts between providers, you may start paying extra.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-a-normal-phone-call-and-calling-via-messaging-apps"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-a-normal-phone-call-and-calling-via-messaging-apps" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between a normal phone call and calling via messaging apps?"></a>What is the difference between a normal phone call and calling via messaging apps?</h2><p>While a lot of people call the two things “just making a phone call”, there is an important difference between a “real phone call” and using messaging apps like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://duo.google.com/about/">Google Duo</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> (no preference just following the lexicographical order).</p><p>When you are making a real phone call, i.e. you are using the actual phone in your smartphone, your voice is transmitted via the <strong>mobile network</strong> (no data plan required), you are connected on, and routed towards the phone number you are using.<br>It is important to notice that this has nothing to do with any data plan you have or to the fact that you are connected to a <strong>WiFi network</strong>. A phone call depends solely on the phone network you are connected to. If your phone is connected to a WiFi network, but is not connected to the phone network, you cannot make a call. (I will not cover the case of operators with Call over WiFi, like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/features/wifi-calling.html">AT&amp;T</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6157793?hl=en">Google Fi</a>, as it requires enabled smartphone and doesn’t work in all countries)<br>What you are going to pay is dependent solely on your voice plan. If you have a finite amount of minutes you can call for free up to this limit and you will start paying extra after you go over it.</p><p>When you are using a messaging app to make a call, i.e. you are not using the actual phone in your smartphone, your voice is transmitted via the Internet. This is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VOIP</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">Voice Over Internet Protocol</a>).<br>It is important to notice that this has nothing to do with any voice plan you have or that you are connected to a <strong>phone network</strong>. These kind of phone calls can work with either a <strong>mobile network</strong> (data plan required) or via a <strong>WiFi network</strong>.<br>What you are going to pay is dependent solely on your data plan. If you are connected to a WiFi network you can call for free as much as you want, regardless to being connected to a mobile network. If you are connected only to a mobile network, and you have a finite amount of data in your plan (generally expressed in multiples of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Unit_multiples">GB</a>s or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Unit_multiples">MB</a>s), you can call for free up to when your phone reaches this data, not minutes, limit and you will start paying extra after you go over it.</p><h2 id="So-what-is-the-difference-when-I’m-roaming"><a href="#So-what-is-the-difference-when-I’m-roaming" class="headerlink" title="So what is the difference when I’m roaming?"></a>So what is the difference when I’m roaming?</h2><p>Here it really depends on your plan. If you have <strong>free minutes</strong> or <strong>free data</strong> use it as you prefer. I will focus on the case in which you don’t have them, or you have already ended them.</p><p>I will use the current (2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;31) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.swisscom.ch/en/residential/plans-rates/inone-mobile/roaming.html">Swisscom roaming costs</a> as an example.</p><p>The cost of a normal phone call is <code>0.60 CHF</code> per minute, while the cost of data is <code>4.90 CHF</code> for the first <code>200 MB</code> of traffic, which is <code>0.0245 CHF</code> per <code>MB</code>.<br>Looking fast at the numbers you may think that a phone call is way cheaper than data. In this case you are making a mistake: you are comparing a cost per minute to a cost per MB.</p><h3 id="How-can-I-convert-MB-to-Minutes"><a href="#How-can-I-convert-MB-to-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="How can I convert MB to Minutes?"></a>How can I convert MB to Minutes?</h3><blockquote><p>Well, you can’t</p></blockquote><p>But what you really want is…</p><h3 id="How-many-MB-are-used-for-a-Minute-of-call"><a href="#How-many-MB-are-used-for-a-Minute-of-call" class="headerlink" title="How many MB are used for a Minute of call?"></a>How many MB are used for a Minute of call?</h3><p>It depends on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate">bitrate</a>, i.e. the number of bits that are transmitted per unit of time.<br>The bitrate depends on many factors (e.g. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec">codec</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking)">encapsulation</a>, …), but I promised I would have avoided details.</p><p>I will use data on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-bandwidth-Kbps-does-a-WhatsApp-call-require">WhatsApp</a> that I was able to find.<br>I will use the worst case scenario: <code>64 kbps</code> (64 Kilo bits per second), which means that <code>8 KB</code> (or if you prefer <code>~0.008 MB</code>) are needed for each second of the call.</p><p>So the answer to our question is:</p><blockquote><p><code>0.48 MB</code> per minute.</p></blockquote><h3 id="So-how-can-I-compare-them"><a href="#So-how-can-I-compare-them" class="headerlink" title="So how can I compare them?"></a>So how can I compare them?</h3><p>Let’s compare them as cost per minute.</p><p>For a normal phone call, while roaming, we know the cost in our case <code>0.60 CHF</code> per minute.<br>For a phone call via a messaging app the cost is <code>~0.012 CHF</code> per minute (<code>0.48 MB</code> per minute multiplied by <code>0.0245 CHF</code> per <code>MB</code>).</p><p>This may be not fair as in the contract we are considering you pay <code>4.90 CHF</code> regardless of using the whole <code>200 MB</code> or not.<br>In this case we can consider how long can you call with this <code>4.90 CHF</code>.<br>With a normal phone call you can call for a bit more of <code>8</code> minutes, while with a call via a messaging app you can call for more than <code>6</code> hours and <code>48</code> minutes.</p><h2 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2><p>If you are roaming and you have a WiFi connection prefer using a messaging app, you will have no hard limits.
