Today has been released the version 3.3.5 of [RSciTE][url-rscite-website], a free text editor available in English and Italian.

[RSciTE][url-rscite-website] is (using Linux terminology) a distribution of [SciTE][url-scite-website] that integrates a lot of useful and powerful add-ons.

This project is carried out from Roberto Rossi, and italian developer.

From this version (3.3.5) [RSciTE][url-rscite-website] integrates the functionality Calculator that allows to evaluate a mathematical function (even a complex one) without leaving the editor.

In order to implement this functionality [MathParseKit][url-mathparsekit-repository] has been chosen.

This is the first project that integrates [MathParseKit][url-mathparsekit-repository] and I hope there will be more to come.

If you don't know [RSciTE][url-rscite-website] yet, I invite you to try it, you will be amazed by all the functionality that are hidden inside this editor.
