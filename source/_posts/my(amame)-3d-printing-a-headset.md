3D printing often seams magical.
In a few hours you can print complex objects that are functionally equivalent to off-the-shelf products.

A few years ago I stumbled on [this video from Maker's Muse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAR-1Z9nAAo).
They were testing out a 3D printable headset called [head(amame)](https://headamame.com/).
I thought that was really interesting, but that my 3D printing knowledge was not good enough to finish such a project.

That changed recently.
With the release of [head(amame) v2.1](https://www.printables.com/model/534566-headamame-v21-3d-printable-hi-fi-headphones) I thought it was the time to try this out.

Also...
> I needed a new headset

The options were:
1. I could have ordered a fully assembled version.
2. I could have ordered a kit, printed some parts myself, and assembled it.

So I __obviously__ went with option (3), i.e. order my own components, modify the design to align it with my requirements and components, learn how to use PETG and TPU, 3D print it in PETG and TPU, solder a bunch of stuff, assembled it, and...
__hope that I didn't make some rookie mistake.__

## Changes to the design

### 3.5mm jack
While I think that the original design with the 2 Mini-XLRs is really cool, especially to audio experts, it is a bit excessive to me.
__I just wanted a good old 3.5mm jack.__

And here comes the community.
An [adapter](https://www.printables.com/model/555791-headamame-35mm-jack-adapter) from the Mini-XLR socket to a relatively standard 3.5mm jack is already available out there.

### A single stereo cable

While I think that audio experts will really don't like this...
__I just wanted a single cable.__

So...
a few changes to the design later...
Here is [my modified version](https://www.printables.com/model/1442981-headamame-cones-for-a-top-side-to-side-wire) which adds 2 additional ports on the top for a 3.5mm jack which will connect the 2 sides.

A bit of clever, maybe not, wiring, i.e. having the right channel being routed through the left ear, and the "but you will end up having different wire lengths to the 2 sides" comment.

With a bit of ["extra"](https://www.printables.com/model/235168-headamame-extras) heap from the community and even the problem of fixing the cable in place is solved.

### 105mm cushions

While I really like the design of the standard kit, I really wanted to be able to find replacement cushions.

So...

Here is [my modified version](https://www.printables.com/model/1442968-105mm-earpad-mounts-for-headamame) which allows to use 105mm cushions.

### 3D print as much as possible

While I could have still bought some of the original components, I really wanted to try to print as much as possible.

Here comes the community help again.
Here is a replacement [Rubber Bumper](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6156368) and a [Headband](https://www.printables.com/model/163446-headamame-printed-headband).

## Preparation

After a few days printing and a few hours soldering... here are all the necessary parts.

## Result

A few hours of assembling later... here is the final result.

> Would I do it again?

Absolutely I already started printing some parts to help a friend build its own.

## The rookie mistakes

I accidentally swapped some wires which forced me to take it a part a figure out a how to rewire it in place without having the resolder everything from scratch...

> Don't look inside

N.B. The version of my friend will have the wires soldered correctly ;-)
